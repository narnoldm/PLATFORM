# PLATFORM 

[Documentation](https://narnoldm.github.io/PLATFORM/)

# Abstract 

In the scientific model reduction community a variety of 
decomposition techniques are used for analysis of complex
spatio-temporal systems as well as reduced-order model 
development. Application of these methods to more complex
problems require memory usage that often exceeds that of 
single machines. Parallel Linear Algebra Tool FOr Reduced Modeling  (PLATFORM) is a MPI 
C++ code built upon the ScaLAPACK toolset of distributed
Linear Algebra to address these challenges.



# Statement of need

In the current development of projection based reduced-order models a 
basis is generated from a "data matrix". This matrix is sized as 
(degrees of freedom x number of timesteps). For development problems 
this is often small enough to be done in the scritping environement. 
Additionally in the cases where one of the given dimensions of small
method of snapshots() can be utilized. (however at wall time costs
due to file I/O) However as attempts are made to apply these methods 
to large problems other tools must be used to overcome the memory 
and I/O problem. PLATFORM aims to make overcoming these issues easier
without users needing to understand the depths of distributed
linear algebra computing.


# Requirments

PLATFORM is a MPI code and will require a valid MPI installation. 
The code has been tested with Intel MPI, OpenMPI, and MPICH.
Additionally PDP is built upon the distributed 
linear algebra frame work of ScaLAPACK and its associated 
libraries. 

For HPC machines: 
Depending on the architechture a scientific computing library
should availible. (e.g. Intel MKL, IBM ESSL) 


For Local Machine Users/Debugging:
The ScaLAPACK libraries are availible on NetLib. However it is 
recommended to use the Intel oneAPI which are publically availible.



# Installation

PLATFORM uses the out of source CMake system. The CMake system will do its best 
to determine your configuration but you may need to specify the compiler 
to ensure a good build.

Create a build directory and create build configuration

```bash 
mkdir build
cmake ../PDP_cmake
```

```bash
make
```

And then launch the tests

```bash
make test
```

# Documentation
The documentation can be generated by running doxygen by 

```bash 
doxygen doxygen.input
```
